          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata, born on December 28, 1937, in Bombay (now Mumbai),
            India, is an iconic Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and former
            chairman of Tata Sons. He is a member of the prominent Tata family,
            a family synonymous with the growth and development of modern
            industry in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata comes from a family with a long history of philanthropy
            and business leadership. He is the son of Naval Tata and Soonoo
            Commisariat and the great-grandson of Tata Group founder, Jamsetji
            Tata. He received his early education at the Campion School in
            Mumbai and later pursued architecture and structural engineering
            studies at Cornell University and Harvard Business School.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata began his career with the Tata Group in 1962. He
            initially worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel and gradually moved
            through various positions within the company. He was deeply
            influenced by the values and ethos of the Tata Group and its
            commitment to societal welfare.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1991, Ratan Tata became the Chairman of Tata Sons, the holding
            company of the Tata Group. Under his leadership, the Tata Group
            expanded globally, acquiring major international companies and
            reinforcing its presence in various industries such as automobiles,
            steel, information technology, telecommunications, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of Ratan Tata's most notable achievements was overseeing the
            acquisition of major global brands like Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley,
            and Corus during his tenure. He is credited with steering the Tata
            Group into the league of global conglomerates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ratan Tata's leadership style has always been characterized by a
            focus on innovation, ethics, and sustainable development. He
            emphasized the importance of corporate social responsibility, and
            the Tata Group under his guidance engaged in several philanthropic
            activities and social initiatives.

                Everyone told us it couldn’t be done without having a joint
                venture or a partnership with an international company. That if
                I did this, I would be linked to failure. But we went ahead
                anyway. There were technical issues and many lessons we learned.
                It was a wonderful experience to be breaking new ground. The
                chances to give up were many. We stayed the course, worked out
                each issue, and that was the birth of India’s 1st indigenous
                car, The Tata Indica.

                What really motivated me, and sparked a desire to produce such a
                vehicle, was constantly seeing Indian families on scooters,
                maybe the child sandwiched between the mother and father, riding
                to wherever they were going, often on slippery roads. One of the
                benefits of being in the School of Architecture, it had taught
                me to doodle when I was free. At first we were trying to figure
                out how to make two wheelers safer, the doodles became four
                wheels, no windows, no doors, just a basic dune buggy. But I
                finally decided it should be a car. The Nano, was always meant
                for all our people.

                Mr Ratan Naval Tata is the Emeritus Chairman of Tata Sons, Tata
                Industries, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals. He has
                been the Chairman of Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy
                Services, Tata Power, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Chemicals, Taj
                Group and Tata Teleservices. During his tenure, the Tata Group’s
                revenues grew manifold, totalling over $100 billion in 2011-12.
                Mr Tata joined the Tata Group in 1962. After serving in various
                companies, he was appointed Director-in-Charge of the National
                Radio Electronics Company Limited in 1971. In 1981, he was named
                Chairman of Tata Industries and was responsible for transforming
                it into a group strategy think-tank, and a promoter of new
                ventures in high technology businesses.

                It's back to square one with Air India -- almost after 67 years.
                It seems that Tata Group will be in the cockpit of Air India
                once again as the government has reportedly chosen it as the
                winning bidder. While the deal is yet to be announced, some
                reports suggest Air India has been valued at Rs 10,000-15,000
                crore in addition to the Rs 23,000 crore of debt that will be
                taken over by Tata Group as part of the sale.The deal would make
                Tata Group the second-largest airline operator in the domestic
                market with 26.7 per cent market share, and behind the market
                leader IndiGo (57 per cent market share). In the international
                segment though, Tata Group would emerge as the leader with the
                lion's market share.

                I remember the first time I ever visited Jamshedpur, when I was
                on holiday from college. Mr. R. G. Da Costa and Mr. J. D.
                Chokshi invited me to visit the Telco plant and have a walk
                around the plant. This trip was much before I started working on
                the Tata Steel floor, my first interaction with the legacy city
                of Jamshedpur.
